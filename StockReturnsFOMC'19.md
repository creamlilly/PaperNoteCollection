## 1. Summary

### Motivation
The paper investigates whether the federal reserve have a substantial impact on the stock market. Previous studies focuses on Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcement days or the 24-hour period just before scheduled FOMC annoucements. However, the overall impact of the Fed on the stock market could be much larger than previously thought as monetary policy news may not arrive only on FOMC annoucnement dates. In addition, focusing only on FOMC announcement dates could lead to small-sample issues. This paper overcomes these challenges by studying the evolution of stock returns over the fll cycle of days between scheduled FOMC meetings.



### Data & Method
1994 through 2016.
Date 0 is the day of a scheduled FOMC meeting. For two-day meetings, date 0 refers to the second day, the announcement day. The paper includes 10 days (2 weeks) before Day 0 and 40 days after Day 0. The five-day stock excess return is defineed as the five-day cumulative stock return from day t to t+4 mins the five-day cumulative return on 20-day Treasury bills from day t to t+4.

### Main Findings
The paper finds that the equity premim is earned entirely in weeks 0,2,4 and 6 in FOMC cycle time. The Fed leads to large reductions in the quity premium via unexpectedly accommodating policy. News about monetary policy has reached market through systematic informal communication of Fed officials with the media and ifnancial sector.
